# Waffle Studio Code Test

Congratulations on advancing to the next stage of our application process! We would like to invite you to undertake our code test which is outlined as a small project brief below. We look forward to your submission and hope that you find some joy and satisfaction in whatever you make.

The deadline for your submission will have been sent to you in a message by the Hiring Manager.

## Project brief

**Create a playable web-based Sudoku puzzle game.**

You may take this simple brief and run with it to your heartâ€™s content. We have kept it intentionally short to encourage your own interpretation. The look, feel and features of the game are completely up to you, as is the structure (single/daily/saga etc).

We encourage you to use this as an opportunity to showcase your ability as a web developer and to apply any relevant design patterns and/or best practices.

As a minimum, it should present a Sudoku puzzle and allow the player to complete it.

## Tech stack

At Waffle Studio, we build our games using a mixture of vanilla JavaScript, React, a smattering of convenience libraries and mostly pure CSS to drive style and moments of delight. To that end, it is expected for your submission to broadly follow this.

If you feel your game would benefit from a backend, we use NodeJS. Please note however that a backend is not a requirement for this project.

## What we are looking for

We are looking for a well-scoped project given the time allowed. A completed and well polished experience will fare better than a very ambitious but incomplete project.

We would like to see examples of good programming practice, documentation, skilled use of frontend technologies, and evidence of good user experience design.

Finally, we are not expecting a completely novel puzzle experience, but instead looking for your interpretation of a pre-existing and much-loved puzzle game.

## Your submission

- Partial or full completion of your game is to be submitted no later than the agreed deadline.

- The full source code for your game any any supporting files/folders must be made available for download via Github (or similar). Include a link to this with your submission.

- Please include clear instructions on how to build your project from source.

- Your submission must also be able to be demoed/critiqued without us having to explicitly build or install it; **please provide a link to a hosted version of your game[^1].**

- Submit your project by emailing [jobs@waffle.dev](mailto:jobs@waffle.dev?subject=Full%20Stack%20Engineer%20Code%20Test%20Submission) with the subject line: "Full Stack Engineer Code Test Submission".
